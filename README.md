This repository contains the modeling framework for quantifying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow velocity from fMRI inflow signals.

See the [v1.0 tag](https://github.com/baarbod/tofmodel/releases/tag/v1.0) for the version of the code used in:

**Ashenagar et al., 2025**  
*Modeling dynamic inflow effects in fMRI to quantify cerebrospinal fluid flow.*

v1.0 is uploaded for reference to the exact methods used in the paper.
However, please use the latest version for improved usability and broader compatibility.

> **Note:** The codebase is currently being updated to enhance the pipeline and ensure compatibility with other computing environments. An updated readme will be made to illustrate example usage and detailed features of this repository.

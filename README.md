This repository contains the modeling framework used for quantifying CSF flow velocity from fMRI Inflow Signals.

See tag v1.0 for the version of the code used in our paper: Ashenagar et al. 2025 Modeling dynamic inflow effects in fMRI to quantify cerebrospinal fluid flow
For using this framework, please use the latest version.

***Currently the code is being updated to faciliate easy usage of the pipeline and compatibility with other computing environments.
